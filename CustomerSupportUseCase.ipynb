    "## Step 1: Generating Synthetic Customer Support Data\n",

    "1. Create realistic customer comments.  \n",

    "**Key Insights**  \n",
    "- **Structured Output**: The prompt needs to provide clear instructions about the expected questions and solutions along with examples how to structure the questions and solutions.\n",
    "- **Customization**: The inclusion of domain-specific seed topics (e.g., Cloudera AI, Data Engineering) ensures relevance to the target use case and create diverse synthetic data.\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use temperature value 1, to balance between generation accuracy and creativity.\n",
    "- **Top_k**: Use a value (250) to ensure a wide range of generation paths are explored\n"
